## Description

This tutorial will showcase analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data following the tidy data paradigm. The tidy data paradigm provides a standard way to organise data values within a dataset, where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and data is manipulated using an easy-to-understand vocabulary. Most importantly, the data structure remains consistent across manipulation and analysis functions.

This can be achieved with the integration of packages present in the R CRAN and Bioconductor ecosystem, including [tidySingleCellExperiment](https://stemangiola.github.io/tidySingleCellExperiment/), [tidySummarizedExperiment](https://stemangiola.github.io/tidySummarizedExperiment/), [tidybulk](https://stemangiola.github.io/tidybulk/) and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). These packages are part of the tidytranscriptomics suite that introduces a tidy approach to RNA sequencing data representation and analysis. For more information see the [tidy transcriptomics blog](https://stemangiola.github.io/tidytranscriptomics/).

### Pre-requisites

# Introduction to tidySingleCellExperiment

```{r message = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
library(colorspace)
library(dittoSeq)
```

SingleCellExperiment is a very popular analysis toolkit for single cell RNA sequencing data [@butler2018integrating; @stuart2019comprehensive].

Here we load single-cell data in SingleCellExperiment object format. This data is peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from metastatic breast cancer patients.


```{r}
# load single cell RNA sequencing data
sce_obj <- bioc2022tidytranscriptomics::sce_obj

# take a look
sce_obj
```

tidySingleCellExperiment provides a bridge between the SingleCellExperiment single-cell package and the tidyverse [@wickham2019welcome]. It creates an invisible layer that enables viewing the SingleCellExperiment object as a tidyverse tibble, and provides SingleCellExperiment-compatible *dplyr*, *tidyr*, *ggplot* and *plotly* functions.

If we load the *tidySingleCellExperiment* package and then view the single cell data, it now displays as a tibble.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidySingleCellExperiment)

sce_obj
```

If we want to revert to the standard SingleCellExperiment view we can do that.

```{r}
options("restore_SingleCellExperiment_show" = TRUE)
sce_obj
```

If we want to revert back to tidy SingleCellExperiment view we can.

```{r}
options("restore_SingleCellExperiment_show" = FALSE)
sce_obj
```

It can be interacted with using [SingleCellExperiment commands](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/SingleCellExperiment/inst/doc/intro.html) such as `assays`.

```{r}
assays(sce_obj)
```

We can also interact with our object as we do with any tidyverse tibble.

## Tidyverse commands

We can use tidyverse commands, such as `filter`, `select` and `mutate` to explore the tidySingleCellExperiment object. Some examples are shown below and more can be seen at the tidySingleCellExperiment website [here](https://stemangiola.github.io/tidySingleCellExperiment/articles/introduction.html#tidyverse-commands-1).

We can use `filter` to choose rows, for example, to see just the rows for the cells in G1 cell-cycle stage.

```{r}
sce_obj |> filter(Phase == "G1")
```

We can use `select` to view columns, for example, to see the filename, total cellular RNA abundance and cell phase.

```{r}
sce_obj |> select(file, nCount_RNA, Phase)
```
A couple of things to note with `select`

* As we did not output the .cell column we get a tibble instead of a SingleCellExperiment object and a message to let us know: `tidySingleCellExperiment says: Key columns are missing. A data frame is returned for independent data analysis.` This is ok as it's what we want here when viewing the columns.

* If we use `select` to output the .cell (key) column we will also get any view-only columns returned, such as the UMAP columns generated during the preprocessing.
    ```{r}
sce_obj |> select(.cell, nCount_RNA, Phase)
    ```

We can use `mutate` to create a column. For example, we could create a new `Phase_l` column that contains a lower-case version of `Phase`.

```{r}
sce_obj |>
  mutate(Phase_l = tolower(Phase)) |>
  select(Phase, Phase_l)
```

We can use tidyverse commands to polish an annotation column. We will extract the sample, and group information from the file name column into separate columns.

```{r}
# First take a look at the file column
sce_obj |> select(file)
```

```{r}
# Create column for sample
sce_obj <- sce_obj |>
  # Extract sample
  extract(file, "sample", "../data/.*/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/outs.+", remove = FALSE)

# Take a look
sce_obj |> select(sample, everything())
```

We could use tidyverse `unite` to combine columns, for example to create a new column for sample id combining the sample and patient id (BCB) columns.

```{r}
sce_obj <- sce_obj |> unite("sample_id", sample, BCB, remove = FALSE)

# Take a look
sce_obj |> select(sample_id, sample, BCB)
```


# Case study

## Data pre-processing

The object `sce_obj` we've been using was created as part of a study on breast cancer systemic immune response. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been sequenced for RNA at the single-cell level. The steps used to generate the object are summarised below.

-   `scran`, `scater`, and `DropletsUtils` packages have been used to eliminate empty droplets and dead cells. Samples were individually quality checked and cells were filtered for good gene coverage.

-   Variable features were identified using `modelGeneVar`.

-   Read counts were scaled and normalised using logNormCounts from `scuttle`.

-   Data integration was performed using `fastMNN` with default parameters.

-   PCA performed to reduce feature dimensionality.

-   Nearest-neighbor cell networks were calculated using 30 principal components.

-   2 UMAP dimensions were calculated using 30 principal components.

-   Cells with similar transcriptome profiles were grouped into clusters using Louvain clustering from `scran`.

## Analyse custom signature

The researcher analysing this dataset wanted to identify gamma delta T cells using a gene signature from a published paper [@Pizzolato2019]. We'll show how that can be done here.

With tidySingleCellExperiment's `join_features` we can view the counts for genes in the signature as columns joined to our single cell tibble.

```{r}
sce_obj |>
  join_features(c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2", "CD8A", "CD8B"), shape = "wide")
```

We can use tidyverse `mutate` to create a column containing the signature score. To generate the score, we scale the sum of the 4 genes, CD3D, TRDC, TRGC1, TRGC2, and subtract the scaled sum of the 2 genes, CD8A and CD8B. `mutate` is powerful in enabling us to perform complex arithmetic operations easily.

```{r}
sce_obj |>
    
  join_features(c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2", "CD8A", "CD8B"), shape = "wide") |>
    
  mutate(
    signature_score =
      scales::rescale(CD3D + TRDC + TRGC1 + TRGC2, to = c(0, 1)) -
        scales::rescale(CD8A + CD8B, to = c(0, 1))
  ) |>
    
  select(signature_score, everything())
```

The gamma delta T cells could then be visualised by the signature score using Bioconductor's visualisation functions.

```{r}
sce_obj |>
    
  join_features(
    features = c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2", "CD8A", "CD8B"), shape = "wide"
  ) |>
    
  mutate(
    signature_score =
      scales::rescale(CD3D + TRDC + TRGC1 + TRGC2, to = c(0, 1)) -
        scales::rescale(CD8A + CD8B, to = c(0, 1))
  ) |>
    
  scater::plotUMAP(colour_by = "signature_score")
```

The cells could also be visualised using the popular and powerful `ggplot2` package, enabling the researcher to use ggplot functions they were familiar with, and to customise the plot with great flexibility.

```{r}
sce_obj |>
    
  join_features(
    features = c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2", "CD8A", "CD8B"), shape = "wide"
  ) |>
    
  mutate(
    signature_score =
      scales::rescale(CD3D + TRDC + TRGC1 + TRGC2, to = c(0, 1)) -
        scales::rescale(CD8A + CD8B, to = c(0, 1))
  ) |>
    
  # plot cells with high score last so they're not obscured by other cells
  arrange(signature_score) |>
    
  ggplot(aes(UMAP_1, UMAP_2, color = signature_score)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "Spectral") +
  bioc2022tidytranscriptomics::theme_multipanel
```

For exploratory analyses, we can select the gamma delta T cells, the red cluster on the left with high signature score. We'll filter for cells with a signature score > 0.7.

```{r}
sce_obj_gamma_delta <-
    
  sce_obj |>
    
  join_features(
    features = c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2", "CD8A", "CD8B"), shape = "wide"
  ) |>
    
  mutate(
    signature_score =
      scales::rescale(CD3D + TRDC + TRGC1 + TRGC2, to = c(0, 1)) -
        scales::rescale(CD8A + CD8B, to = c(0, 1))
  ) |>
    
  filter(signature_score > 0.7)
```

For comparison, we show the alternative using base R and SingleCellExperiment.

```{r eval=FALSE}
counts_positive <-
  assay(sce_obj, "counts")[c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2"), ] |>
  colSums() |>
  scales::rescale(to = c(0, 1))

counts_negative <-
  assay(sce_obj, "counts")[c("CD8A", "CD8B"), ] |>
  colSums() |>
  scales::rescale(to = c(0, 1))

sce_obj$signature_score <- counts_positive - counts_negative

sce_obj_gamma_delta <- sce_obj[, sce_obj$signature_score > 0.7]
```

We can then focus on just these gamma delta T cells and chain Bioconductor and tidyverse commands together to analyse.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(batchelor)
library(igraph)
library(scater)
library(scran)
library(magrittr)

sce_obj_gamma_delta <-
    
  sce_obj_gamma_delta |>
    
  # Reanalyse
  multiBatchNorm(batch = colData(sce_obj_gamma_delta)$sample) |>
  fastMNN(batch = colData(sce_obj_gamma_delta)$sample) |>
    
  # Join old information
  left_join(as_tibble(sce_obj_gamma_delta)) |>
    
  # Dimension reduction
  runUMAP(ncomponents = 2, dimred = "corrected")

# Assign clusters to the 'colLabels'
# of the SingleCellExperiment object
sce_obj_gamma_delta <-
    
  sce_obj_gamma_delta |>
    
  mutate(
    cluster =
      colLabels(sce_obj_gamma_delta) <- # from SingleCellExperiment
        sce_obj_gamma_delta |>
        buildSNNGraph(use.dimred = "corrected") |> # from scran - shared nearest neighbour
        cluster_walktrap() %$% # from igraph
        membership
  )


sce_obj_gamma_delta |> select(batch, cluster, everything())
```

It is also possible to visualise the cells as a 3D plot using plotly.
The example data used here only contains a few genes, for the sake of time and size in this demonstration, but below is how you could generate the 3 dimensions needed for 3D plot with a full dataset. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
single_cell_object |>
  RunUMAP(dims = 1:30, n.components = 3L, spread = 0.5, min.dist = 0.01, n.neighbors = 10L)
```

We'll demonstrate creating a 3D plot using some data that has 3 UMAP dimensions. This is a fantastic way to visualise both reduced dimensions and metadata in the same representation. 

```{r umap plot 2, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
pbmc <- bioc2022tidytranscriptomics::sce_obj_UMAP3

pbmc |>
  plot_ly(
    x = ~`UMAP_1`,
    y = ~`UMAP_2`,
    z = ~`UMAP_3`,
    color = ~cell_type,
    colors = dittoSeq::dittoColors()
  ) %>%
  add_markers(size = I(1))
```

# Exercises

Using the `sce_obj`:

1. What proportion of all cells are gamma-delta T cells? Use signature_score > 0.7 to identify gamma-delta T cells.

2. There is a cluster of cells characterised by a low RNA output (nCount_RNA < 100). Identify the cell composition (cell_type) of that cluster.

# Pseudobulk analyses

Next we want to identify genes whose transcription is affected by treatment in this dataset, comparing treated and untreated patients. We can do this with pseudobulk analysis. We aggregate cell-wise transcript abundance into pseudobulk samples and can then perform hypothesis testing using the very well established bulk RNA sequencing tools. For example, we can use edgeR in tidybulk to perform differential expression testing. For more details on pseudobulk analysis see [here](https://hbctraining.github.io/scRNA-seq/lessons/pseudobulk_DESeq2_scrnaseq.html).

We want to do it for each cell type and the tidy transcriptomics ecosystem makes this very easy. 


## Create pseudobulk samples

To create pseudobulk samples from the single cell samples, we will use a helper function called `aggregate_cells`, available in this workshop package. This function will combine the single cells into a group for each cell type for each sample.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(glue)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(patchwork)

# bulk RNA-seq libraries
library(tidybulk)
library(tidySummarizedExperiment)
```

```{r}
pseudo_bulk <-
  sce_obj |>
  bioc2022tidytranscriptomics::aggregate_cells(c(sample, cell_type), assays = "counts")

pseudo_bulk
```

## Tidybulk and tidySummarizedExperiment

With `tidySummarizedExperiment` and `tidybulk` it is easy to split the data into groups and perform analyses on each without needing to create separate objects.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/vignettes/new_SE_usage-01.png")
```

We use tidyverse `nest` to group the data. The command below will create a tibble containing a column with a SummarizedExperiment object for each cell type. `nest` is similar to tidyverse `group_by`, except with `nest` each group is stored in a single row, and can be a complex object such as a plot or SummarizedExperiment.

```{r}
pseudo_bulk |>
  nest(data = -cell_type)
```

To explore the grouping, we can use tidyverse `slice` to choose a row (cell_type) and `pull` to extract the values from a column. If we pull the data column we can view the SummarizedExperiment object. 

```{r}
pseudo_bulk |>
  nest(data = -cell_type) |>
  slice(1) |>
  pull(data)
```

We can then identify differentially expressed genes for each cell type for our condition of interest, treated versus untreated patients. We use tidyverse `map` to apply differential expression functions to each cell type group in the nested data. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Differential transcription abundance
pseudo_bulk <-
    
  pseudo_bulk |>
    
  nest(data = -cell_type) |>
    
  # map accepts a data column (.x) and applies functions to each element
  mutate(data = map(
    data,
    ~ .x |>
      # Now using tidybulk on SummarizedExperiment
      identify_abundant(factor_of_interest = treatment) |>
      scale_abundance() |>
      test_differential_abundance(~treatment)
  ))
```

The output is again a tibble containing a SummarizedExperiment object for each cell type.

```{r}
pseudo_bulk
```

If we pull out the SummarizedExperiment object for the first cell type, as before, we can see it now has columns containing the differential expression results (e.g. logFC, PValue).

```{r}
pseudo_bulk |>
  slice(1) |>
  pull(data)
```

Now we can create plots for significant genes for each cell type, visualising their transcriptional abundance, also without needing to create multiple objects. 

```{r message = FALSE}
pseudo_bulk <-
    
  pseudo_bulk |>
    
  # Filter out significant
  # using a high FDR value as this is toy data
  mutate(data = map(data, ~ filter(.x, FDR < 0.5))) |>
    
  # Filter cell types with no differential abundant gene-transcripts
  # map_int is map that returns integer instead of list
  filter(map_int(data, ~ nrow(.x)) > 0) |>

  # Plot
  # map2 is map that accepts 2 input columns (.x, .y)
  mutate(plot = map2(
    data, cell_type,
    ~ .x |>
      ggplot(aes(treatment, counts_scaled + 1)) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(fill = treatment)) +
      geom_jitter() +
      scale_y_log10() +
      facet_wrap(~.feature) +
      ggtitle(.y)
  ))
```

The output is a nested table with a column containing a plot for each cell type.

```{r}
pseudo_bulk
```

We'll use slice and pull again to have a look at one of the plots.

```{r}
pseudo_bulk |>
  slice(1) |>
  pull(plot)
```

We can extract all plots and plot with `wrap_plots` from the patchwork package. 

```{r, fig.height = 8}
pseudo_bulk |>
  pull(plot) |>
  wrap_plots() &
  bioc2022tidytranscriptomics::theme_multipanel
```
